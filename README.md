# Farcall

## Important!

The gem creation is under active development, current state is: beta. Only JSON format is supported.

## Description

The simple and elegant cross-platform RPC protocol that uses any formatter/transport capable of
transmitting dictionary-like objects, for example, JSON, XML, BSON, BOSS and many others. This gem
supports out of the box JSON and (BOSS)[https://github.com/sergeych/boss_protocol] protocols. 

RPC is made asynchronously, each call can have any return values. While one call is waiting,
other calls can be executed. The protocol is bidirectional Call parameters could be
both arrays of arguments and keyword arguments, return value could be any object, e.g. array, 
dictionary, wahtever.

Exception/errors transmitting is also supported.

The interface is very simple and rubyish:

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
    gem 'farcall'
    # If you want to use binary-effective boss encoding:
    # gem 'noss-protocol', '>= 1.4.1' 
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install farcall

## Usage

```ruby

    # The sample class that exports all its methods to the remote callers:
    #
    class TestProvider < Farcall::Provider
    
      attr :foo_calls, :a, :b
    
      def foo a, b, optional: 'none'
        @foo_calls = (@foo_calls || 0) + 1
        @a, @b     = a, b
        return "Foo: #{a+b}, #{optional}"
      end
    end
    
    # create instance and export it to some connected socket:
    TestProvider.new socket: connected_socket # default format is JSON
    
    # or using boss, if you need to pass dates and binary data
    TestProvider.new socket: connected_socket, format: :boss
```

Suppose whe have some socket connected to one above, then TestProvider methods are available via
this connection:

```ruby

    i = Farcall::Interface.new socket: client_socket
    # or
    # i = Farcall::Interface.new socket: client_socket, format: :boss

    # Plain arguments
    i.foo(10, 20).should == 'Foo: 30, none'
    
    # Plain and keyword arguments
    i.foo(5, 6, optional: 'yes!').should == 'Foo: 11, yes!'

    # the exceptions on the remote side are conveyed:
    expect(-> { i.foo() }).to raise_error Farcall::RemoteError

    # new we can read results from the remote side state:
    i.a.should == 5
    i.b.should == 6
```

More creation options ofr both provider and interface creation are:

* `endpoint:` at this point please refrain of using it as endpoint interface is going to change a 
              bit
* `transport:` subclass the `Farcall::Transport` and provide your own. It overrides `socket:`, 
               `input:` and `ouput:` parameters.
* `input:` and `output:` should be presented both or none - override `socket` - provide streams to
                         build the transport over.
